Once upon a time there was a green cow named Marvin. Marvin liked to moo and sleep, but most of all he liked to eat grass. One day when going to the watering hole, Marvin looked into his reflection and saw that he had turned green!
Marvin had been green for a very long time, but he never paid much attention to the way he looked. Thinking he had just recently turned green, Marvin started to worry. "What if I have Mad Cow Disease?", he thought frantically.

But then, Marvin remembered his cousin Larry, who was blue.  So, Marvin decided to go on over to find his cousin to ask what it was like to be a bright color.


When Marvin caught up to Larry, Larry laughed.

Larry said, "Yo, Marvin, looking green."

Marvin then began to cry.

Larry said,  "Aw Marvin, I didn't mean to offend you! I was just trying to compliment your color!" 

Marvin cried even harder. He was a fragile cow.

But not as fragile as a porcelain cow. Marvin wouldn't take to being porcelain very well. He liked to frolic in the fields, and that could be very dangerous for a porcelain cow.

Larry didn't really know what to say now. 
After all, HE was the one who was blue, yet you didn't see him crying. 
And what was wrong with being green? 
The camouflage might even help on days when you get extra hungry and want to remain hidden in the fields for a longer time. 
Quite frankly, Marvin was being rather insensitive--after all, it isn't easy being blue, either.
