Once upon a time there was an app named inventor.
This app could make other apps.
He made an app named Magic8Ball.
This Magic8Ball app could predict the future.
Ask it a question, and then shake the ball.
It will magically answer your question.
Sometimes it answers correctly!
Other times it fails...
I once asked the magic 8 ball if I could ever meet Orlando Bloom and get his autograph.
It said "Very doubtful."
Fortunately for myself, the 8 ball was wrong. I now have Orlando Bloom's autograph hanging on my wall *swoooonnnnnn*
On occasion the magic 8 ball encounters metaphysical paradoxes
For instance, I asked it whether or not it was a magic 8 ball
It replied, "My sources say no"
This introduces several issues...
First, does this mean the magic 8 ball is not a magic 8 ball? 
And if it's not a magic 8 ball than how can it decide on its own existence?
Second, could it be that these "sources" are the magic 8 ball, 
whereas the device we call the magic 8 ball is simply a medium through which they communicate? 
But this is then a classic mind/body problem; how do we separate one from the other?

Inventor made another app.
It was called StockExchange.
StockExchange could only show stocks and not much else.
