There was a pricetag named Tag. Tag had a quite boring life of pricing
a sweater. One day, however, he fell off of the sweater and was blown
away by a gust of air-conditioning. He was sent spiriling out into the
unknown wilderness, unsure where he would end up.

what's in a tag? what's in a tag? nothing I can see. Aside from a damp one lost out at sea. He came from a faraway land named Smee. But first of all he came from a tree.

His memories as a tree are fleeting. He remembers  being in a field, where he heard a goat bleating. He wanted to talk to the goat, but couldn't muster out a greeting.

The goat wandered over, curious to what it was. His coat was soft and full of fuzz. With a twist or turn of fate, the goat leaned down, and the tag he ate!

The tag wandered down through the goat's throat. But soon it got stuck and the goat couldn't breathe! The goat cried for help, grasping at his throat.

I played Tag when I was little. One time a kid kicked me in the stomach because I tagged him. I didn't want to play tag anymore
