Animal nitrate carbon dioxide. Cows. Horses.
STEAKKKKK. Yes, I count "STEAKKKK." as a sentence. It's the best sentence in the world. Steak is also the best meal in the world. I love steak <3.
Steak really is the best. Most steak comes from cows. However, steaks can also come from bison! Still, everyone knows that REAL steak comes from cows, and theres only one way to eat it: Medium Rare. Chef Gordon Ramsay himself refuses to have a steak cooked well. Like my great great grand papi used to tell me, "If it ain't still mooing, you ain't doing it right. Funny enough I've had steak for the past two days. Two days ago I had regular steak from Annas Tacqueria. Yesterday I had steak and salsa roja which was delicious."
